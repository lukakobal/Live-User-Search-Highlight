# 🔍 React Live User Search

Simple React app demonstrating **controlled input** and **live filtering**.

## 🧠 Concepts
- `useState`
- controlled input
- re-render on state change
- derived data (`filter`)
- conditional rendering

## ⚙️ How it works
- User types into input
- `onChange` updates state
- Component re-renders
- List is filtered and highlighted automatically

## 🚀 Key takeaway
> In React, you update **state**, not the DOM. React handles the UI updates.
